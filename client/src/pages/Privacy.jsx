          TL;DR — We collect only what's needed to run PranixAI. We never sell your data. Your health information stays yours.

      <Section title="1. Information we collect">
        <p>When you register, we collect your name, email address, and a securely hashed password. We never store your password in plain text.</p>
        <p>When you use the symptom checker, we store your input (text, voice transcript, or image reference), the AI-generated assessment, and a timestamp — linked to your account.</p>
        <p>When you book appointments, we store the booking details (doctor name, date, time, reason) linked to your account.</p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="4. Data security">
        <p>All data is stored in MongoDB Atlas with encryption at rest. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt. API communication uses HTTPS/TLS. Authentication uses JWT tokens stored locally in your browser.</p>
